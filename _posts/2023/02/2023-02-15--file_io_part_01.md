ECO3Dxx will supports both structured and unstructured meshes. This requires the file IO needs to support different structures.

For the starter, I will use the MPAS mesh (https://mpas-dev.github.io/) as the default mesh. This leads to the default unstructured data structure.
Because the MPAS mesh is currently using NetCDF file format, the model will provide netcdf file API.

It is also possible to remap some dataset from a different structure to the MPAS mesh as a pre-processing, which will decrease the computational cose during simulations.

For parallel processing, it is possible to use either parallel netcdf or hdf5.
